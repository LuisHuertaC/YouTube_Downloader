# YouTube_Downloader
This is a code that will allow you yo download any video, live or audiofile from youtube, totally free, with no adds or sht like that

Ok, so let's get started with this (for windows only)

First of all you will need to download Python from the main page (https://www.python.org/downloads/), then tick the checkbox "Add Python.exe to PATH" before you install it, after the installation click on "Disable path length limit"

Second, you need create a new folder anywhere you want (create it in Documents or Desktop will be fine), then save the main code (app.py), "setup.bat", "requirements.txt", "styles.css", "index.html" and "cookies.txt" in there 

Third, execute "setup.bat", this will allow your computer to execute the main code without any problems and it'll create a shortcut on you Desktop to the download page, all of this will maybe take its time (depends on how fast is your machine).

Finally, you only need to copy and paste the link of the video you want to download, it will be downloaded on the same folder you pasted the main code

PD: The best part of this code is that it allows you to be a server for your Local Network, it means you can load the same page in any other device conected to the same Wifi or Net and the page will be active for it too, you just need to type the IP of the machine that is running the main code in the device's explorer (something like "192.168.0.1:5000", it depends, maybe yours are different), and don't worry the code will eliminate on its own the file from the "server" and send it automatically to the device who made the request.
